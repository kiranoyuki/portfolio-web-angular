        "My Philosophy is to take complex problems and produce simple and effective designs. I am always intrigued to the way things work in order to understand and discover the fundamental basis of the problem. Such a drive that constantly convinced me that any complex problem always has a simple solution.",
        "I am always looking for the opportunity to learn and share my knowledge through friends, colleagues, and mentors. I find opportunities to expand my wisdom through feedbacks and critics. Ultimately, my goal is to create things that work for a greater good.",
