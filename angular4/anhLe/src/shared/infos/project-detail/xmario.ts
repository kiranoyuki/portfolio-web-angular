            'Behavior tree is not the best method to use for Mario game. Behavior trees have a logical flow that can be followed and capture the behavior or decision mechanism of a character in a game. An AI agent that is implemented with the behavior tree should expect to know how it should react to the environment based on its behavior tree. The behavior tree is quite easy to visualize and is built based on smaller tree to control the characterâ€™s behavior without coding knowledge requirement. However, they require lots of work and planning to set up. It does not allow the AI agent to learn and improve on its action. In case if the planning is missing any edge cases, it would fail to execute the required task.',
            'A Behavior tree is suitable for any AI that is very predictable in order to perform only a set of specific tasks. It becomes much harder to implement a behavior tree for an AI agent that is involved in more random factors and dynamic environments.'
